This folder contains Aspect Scripts designed to build Exploration Scripts.
they are to be run in partnership with custom codes for set levels and is designed to speed up Exploration Script Building

Notes about Scripts:

1. Stage Selection->ExplorationOpen
This is Stage 1 required in Writing your own Exploration Script.
It will take you from the Stage Select Screen, through picking a companion, and beginning the level.
If you are low on NRG this WILL pay for a refill.
